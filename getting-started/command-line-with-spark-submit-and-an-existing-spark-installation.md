# Command line (with spark-submit and an existing Spark installation)

This method gives you more control about the Spark configuration than the experimental standalone jar, in particular you can increase the memory used, change the number of cores, and so on.

If you use Linux, Florian Kellner also kindly contributed an [installation script](https://github.com/fkellner/rumbledb-install-script) for Linux users that roughly takes care of what is described below for you.

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:$warning;">Users of the Python edition (pip install jsoniq) should not have to install Spark manually because the pip package automatically installs pyspark and this contains a Spark 4 installation. However, advanced users who have multiple Spark installations or encounter a Spark version conflict in Python may find the information below useful.</mark>
{% endhint %}

### Install Spark (if you do not have installed already)

RumbleDB requires an Apache Spark installation on Linux, Mac or Windows. Important note: it needs to be either Spark 4, or the Scala 2.13 build of Spark 3.5.

It is straightforward to directly [download it](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html), unpack it and put it at a location of your choosing. We recommend to pick Spark 4.0.0.

### SPARK\_HOME and PATH (you need to check even if you already have an existing installation)

You then need to point the SPARK\_HOMEÂ environment variable to this directory, and to additionally add the subdirectory "bin" within the unpacked directory to the PATH variable. On macOS this is done by adding.

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:$warning;">Users of the Python edition who have additional Spark installations must ensure that SPARK\_HOME and PATH point to a Spark 4 installation. The Python edition does not work with Spark 3.5.</mark>  &#x20;
{% endhint %}

```
export SPARK_HOME=/path/to/spark-4.0.0-bin-hadoop3
export PATH=$SPARK_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

(with SPARK\_HOME appropriately set to match your unzipped Spark directory) to the file .zshrc in your home directory, then making sure to force the change with

```
. ~/.zshrc
```

in the shell. In Windows, changing the PATH variable is done in the control panel. In Linux, it is similar to macOS.

As an alternative, users who love the command line can also install Spark with a package management system instead, such as brew (on macOS) or apt-get (on Ubuntu). However, these might be less predictable than a raw download.

You can test that Spark was correctly installed with:

```
spark-submit --version
```

### Java version (important)

You need to make sure that you have Java 11 (for Spark 3.5) or 17 (for Spark 3.5 or 4.0) or 21 (for Spark 4.0) and that, if you have several versions installed, JAVA\_HOME correctly points to the correct Java installation. Spark only supports Java 11 or 17 or 21 depending on the version.

Spark 4+ is documented to work with both Java 17 and Java 21. If there is an issue with the Java version, RumbleDB will inform you with an appropriate error message. You can check the Java version that is configured on your machine with:

```
java -version
```

### Download the small version of the RumbleDB jar

Like Spark, RumbleDB is just a download and no installation is required.

In order to run RumbleDB, you simply need to download one of the small .jar files from the [download page](https://github.com/RumbleDB/rumble/releases) and put it in a directory of your choice, for example, right besides your data.

If you use Spark 3.5, use rumbledb-2.0.0-for-spark-3.5-scala-2.13.jar.

If you use Spark 4.0, use rumbledb-2.0.0-for-spark-4.0.jar.

These jars do not embed Spark, since you chose to set it up separately. They will work with your Spark installation with the spark-submit command.

Make sure to use the corresponding jar name accordingly in all our instructions in lieu of rumbledb.jar, replacing rumbledb.jar with the actual name of the jar file you downloaded.

In a shell, from the directory where the RumbleDB .jar lies, type, all on one line:

```
spark-submit rumbledb.jar repl
```

replacing rumbledb.jar with the actual name of the jar file you downloaded.

The RumbleDB shell appears:

```

You can now start typing simple queries like the following few examples. Press _three times_ the return key to execute a query.

```

```

or

```

or

```

```
