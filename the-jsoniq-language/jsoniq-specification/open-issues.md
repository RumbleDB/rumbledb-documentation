# Open Issues

The [JSON update syntax](http://jsoniq.org/docs/JSONiqExtensionToXQuery/html/section-json-updates.html) was not integrated yet into the core language. This is planned, and the syntax will be simplified (no json keyword, dot lookup allowed here as well).

The semantics for the [JSON serialization method](http://jsoniq.org/docs/JSONiqExtensionToXQuery/html/section-json-serialization.html) is the same as in the JSONiq Extension to XQuery. It is still under discussion how to escape special characters with the Text output method.
