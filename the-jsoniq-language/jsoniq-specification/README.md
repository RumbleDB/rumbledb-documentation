# JSONiq 1.0

JSONiq 1.0 is the first version of the JSONiq language, currently in use.

It is a cousin of the XQuery 3.0 language and was developed by W3C XML Query Working Group members as a proposal of how to integrate JSON support into the language, while making it appealing to the JSON community, and making it easy for an existing XQuery engine to implement.
